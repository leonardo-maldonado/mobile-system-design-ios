# Mobile System Design for iOS

A comprehensive repository showcasing mobile system design patterns, architectural principles, and best practices for iOS development. This resource demonstrates real-world implementations of common mobile system design challenges through practical use cases.

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository serves as a learning resource for developers interested in understanding mobile system design concepts specifically tailored for iOS applications. Each use case demonstrates different architectural patterns, data management strategies, and performance optimization techniques that are essential for building scalable mobile applications.

## 🏗️ What You'll Learn

- **Clean Architecture Principles**: Implementation of Domain-Driven Design with clear separation of concerns
- **Data Management**: Effective caching strategies, repository patterns, and data source abstractions
- **Performance Optimization**: Image loading, memory management, and network request optimization
- **Modern iOS Development**: SwiftUI and UIKit implementations with protocol-oriented programming
- **Testing Strategies**: Unit testing and UI testing approaches for mobile applications
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and retry mechanisms for mobile environments

## 📱 Use Cases

### ImageGallery (UIKit)
A comprehensive image gallery implementation built with **UIKit**, demonstrating:

- **Architecture**: Clean Architecture with MVVM pattern
- **Features**:
  - Infinite scrolling image gallery
  - Efficient image caching and loading
  - Network retry mechanisms
  - Shimmer loading effects
  - UIKit collection view implementation
- **Key Concepts**:
  - Repository pattern for data abstraction
  - Local and remote data source implementations
  - Memory and disk caching strategies
  - Reactive programming with Combine
  - Error handling and retry logic

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Language**: Swift (latest version)
- **UI Frameworks**: UIKit (current use cases), SwiftUI (future implementations)
- **Architecture**: MVVM + Clean Architecture
- **Reactive Programming**: Combine
- **Testing**: XCTest, XCUITest
- **Dependency Management**: Swift Package Manager

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the desired use case project in Xcode
3. Build and run to see the implementation in action
4. Explore the code to understand the architectural patterns
5. Review the tests to understand the testing strategies

## 🎓 Learning Path

1. **Start with Domain**: Understand the business entities and core logic
2. **Explore Infrastructure**: Learn about data management and external service integration
3. **Study View Layer**: See how the UI connects to the business logic
4. **Review Tests**: Understand testing strategies and implementation
5. **Experiment**: Modify and extend the implementations to deepen your understanding
